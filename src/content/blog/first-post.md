This is my first note in my new digital garden! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and learnings here.

A digital garden is a place where I can cultivate ideas, connect notes, and let my knowledge grow over time. It's less formal than a traditional blog.

## Next Steps
- Learn more about Markdown.
- Explore how to link notes together.
- Customize the look and feel of my garden.
