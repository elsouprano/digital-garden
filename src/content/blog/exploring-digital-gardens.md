Digital gardens are a fascinating way to approach learning and sharing knowledge online. Unlike traditional blogs that often feature polished, chronological posts, digital gardens are more like evolving ecosystems of interconnected notes and ideas.

## Core Ideas
* **Learning in Public:** Share thoughts and notes even if they aren't fully formed.
* **Non-linear Exploration:** Readers (and the author) can navigate through interconnected ideas rather than just following a timeline.
* **Continuous Growth:** Notes are revisited, updated, and cultivated over time.
* **Personal Knowledge Base:** Serves as a public extension of one's own learning process.

This note is just the beginning of exploring this concept. I plan to add more links to resources and examples as I discover them.

This note expands on ideas from my [First Digital Garden Note](/blog/first-post/).
